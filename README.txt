-------------- README for ICLR 2025 Submission 12212 --------------------

There are three folders in this directory. In each is a run.sh which will reproduce our experiments. This can be run with "bash run.sh".

There is a corresponding clean_dir.sh which when run with "bash clean_dir.sh" will restore the directory to its initial condition.

A requirements.txt is presented with the minimum libraries and version needed to run these experiments.
